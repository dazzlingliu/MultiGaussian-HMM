# MultiGaussian-HMM
Hidden Markov Model with multivariate gaussian distribution as observation model.

This framework is designed to anlysis the dynamic funcitonal connectivity of neuroimaging data such as fmri data.The functional connectivity between each brain regions are described by covariance of gaussian distribution of each state.

If you want to test this code, run "HMM_run.m" directly because data file is already included.

simulated data is generated by simTB toolbox(Erhardt et al., 2012).

real fmri data comes from HCP project dataset（Glasser et al.2013).

Input data is T*K dimensions. (T is the time points, K is the dimension of input data(eg.number of brain regions)
All timeseries from different subjects are concatenated.
